Tumour Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on tumor detection using the Random Forest algorithm. The project aims to accurately identify tumors in medical imaging data, achieving over 94% accuracy through advanced machine learning techniques.

Key Features:

- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed a robust model using the Random Forest algorithm to classify tumors based on medical images.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented effective data preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance and reduce computational time. Techniques include image normalization, noise reduction, and feature extraction to prepare the data for modeling.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's parameters and improve its robustness. This process involved fine-tuning parameters such as tree depth, number of trees, and feature selection to achieve optimal performance.
  
Repository Structure:

- **Code**: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks are provided for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
  
- **Data**: Sample medical imaging datasets (anonymized) used for training and testing the tumor detection model.
  
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on project setup, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.
