# Tumor Detection using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a **tumor detection model** that analyzes medical imaging data to classify scans as tumor or non-tumor using machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Medical image analysis is a critical task in healthcare, and this project applies machine learning to detect tumors in medical images. The goal is to help automate tumor diagnosis by training a model to recognize patterns associated with tumor presence.

## 🧠 Model & Approach

- This project implements a **machine learning model** using the **Random Forest algorithm** for binary classification (tumor vs. no tumor).  
- Data preprocessing techniques like normalization and feature extraction are applied to enhance model performance.  
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model accuracy.

The model demonstrates promising classification performance.
